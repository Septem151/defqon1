[Playlist Link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3OVzWd7wwqTsdXprKIkIXD)

Red stage hosts artists that represent the current trends of "Hardstyle", as well as artists that defined the scene to be what it is today. These songs are from artists playing at Defqon.1 2023 and represent the mainstream harder styles genre as a whole:

- [Phuture Noize - Landmines](https://open.spotify.com/track/1p4IMFAoCfzVt4G9rJdYPb)
  - 1:24 - "Hardstyle", don't really know how else to describe it. Screechy lead synth melody with pitched kicks
  - 2:30 - Raw time! Fake drop included and all :)
    > Most raw tracks follow this same formula (starting from 2:30), where there is a melodic buildup, a fake drop, then a mono-pitch kick with the lead melody synth
- [TNT, Darren Styles, Technoboy, Tuneboy - Got The Music](https://open.spotify.com/track/2jssAhP9SMK8S3SfCtqNrs)
  - 1:04 - Classic happy-go-lucky TNT reverse bass into psy-bass which is a common theme in Technoboy/Tuneboy tracks
  - 2:33 - Euphoric hardstyle elements in the melody and its buildup, followed by a fake drop and deep bass then psy-bass
- [Atmozfears, Sound Rush - The Kraken](https://open.spotify.com/track/6qr90TwCwdsRc6Eka4iEup)
  - 0:45 - Lazer-like reverse bass is Sound Rush's style
  - 1:14 - Of course we need the obligatory raw section of the track, followed by a kick showcase that is actually quite interesting
  - 3:58 - This part is not pleasurable to listen to in my opinion... The drop before this is pretty lackluster as well, but it does sound nice
- [Da Tweekaz, Refuzion - Piece of Me](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ep4R3ZU94q7A8RIfC61YD)
  - 2:20 - Emotive melody, some fusion dnb elements and a satisfying raw, pitched kick drop. I particularly like these types of drops
- [D-Block & S-te-Fan, Headhunterz - Keepers Of Our Legacy](https://open.spotify.com/track/7w06cAEK8P7PzQCopSQyuJ)
  - I don't know what the hell D-Block & S-te-Fan are making. The kicks are hollow as fuck and lack any sort of punch. They used to make awesome tracks. (rant over)
- [B-Front, Toneshifterz - Thundercloud (Not Alone)](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ESMY4YltkVVt6fgCPNOPn)
  - 2:34 - Very nice euphoric hardstyle. Pitched DEEP kicks, good melody, some nice stabs
- [Act of Rage, Nolz - Road Rage](https://open.spotify.com/track/5hZuHOC9L0OAYz26BHWsh3)
  - This type of track is very popular nowadays, which feature a variety of raw kicks, building saw synth into a "power section" of kicks
- [Sickmode, Rooler - CLUB BANGER](https://open.spotify.com/track/4f2GJfcDGexOEHgIzIhMwC)
  - Sickmode and Rooler are the defining sound of modern rawstyle
- [Rebelion, Vertile - Numb](https://open.spotify.com/track/5v5rbWpEf9toQLUmMo1JdW)
  - 1:04 - A demonstration of modern raw with what's known as "Zaagkicks" which is an uptempo kick but played at raw's speed of 150~ bpm and has its release drastically extended
  - Basically just a familiar song's melody, then no melody and some kicks, followed by bringing back the melody at the end with the kicks. Boring af
- [Ran-D, Galactixx, E-Life - If Tomorrow Never Comes](https://open.spotify.com/track/3sMtYXf7VpAT0ArrqdfkCw)
  - A more "poppy" hardstyle featuring tons of vocals and easier-sounding kicks
- [Audiotricz - Demons](https://open.spotify.com/track/4J2kS2nlfnjMFr7yRoI02L)
  - Faster hardstyle but still pretty generic, sounds good though
- [Wildstylez, Sound Rush - Glorious](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ZG18NphRGHN4zJKt5lKtO)
  - "Anthem" sounding songs in particular are common at the Red

## BLACK

[Playlist Link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3uN9gW3a8tGu0TGf74bXwU)

The black stage hosts Hardcore, which includes the influencers of both old and new. Hardcore has its roots before hardstyle and is slightly faster with minimal pitching of kicks. Sometimes an older "millenium hardcore" sound can be heard in modern tracks at the black stage. The black stage also has been getting progressively more welcoming to uptempo acts.
